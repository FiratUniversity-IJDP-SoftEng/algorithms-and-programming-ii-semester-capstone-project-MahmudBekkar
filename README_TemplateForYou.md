# Neural Network Visualization - Interactive Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that implements and visualizes [Algorithm Name], developed as part of the Algorithms and Programming II course at Fırat University, Software Engineering Department.

## Algorithm Description

[Provide a comprehensive explanation of your algorithm here. Include the following elements:]

### Problem Definition

[Clearly define the problem that the algorithm solves]

### Mathematical Background

[Explain any mathematical concepts, formulas, or notation relevant to understanding the algorithm]

### Algorithm Steps

1 Initialize weights and biases with small random values.
2 Perform forward propagation to compute the predicted outputs.
3 Calculate the error by comparing predicted outputs with true labels.
4 Backpropagate the error to update weights and biases.
5 Repeat steps 2-4 for a set number of epochs or until convergence.

### Pseudocode

```
initialize weights W1, W2 and biases b1, b2
for epoch in 1 to max_epochs:
    output = forward_propagation(input)
    error = target - output
    update weights and biases using backpropagation

```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(n * m) - [where n is the number of data points and m is the number of neurons - minimal iterations required]
- **Average Case:** O(n * m * epochs) - [average training requires multiple epochs]
- **Worst Case:** O(n * m * epochs) - [maximum epochs needed for convergence]

### Space Complexity

- O(m) - [memory for storing weights, biases, and activations]

## Features

-Interactive user input for training data and parameters.
-Visualization of forward propagation steps.
-Step-by-step explanation of weight updates during training.

- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MahmudBekkar/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

1 Input training data points and labels.
2 Set the number of epochs and learning rate.
3 Click "Train" to start visualization.
4 Observe forward propagation and weight updates step-by-step.

### Example Inputs

Points: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)]
Labels: [0, 1, 1, 0]
Epochs: 1000
Learning Rate: 0.1



## Implementation Details

### Key Components

- `algorithm.py`: Contains the core algorithm implementation
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for data processing
- `visualizer.py`: Functions for visualization

### Code Highlights

```python
# Include a few key code snippets that demonstrate the most important parts of your implementation
def key_function(parameter):
    """
    Docstring explaining what this function does
    """
    # Implementation with comments explaining the logic
    result = process(parameter)
    return result
```

## Testing

This project includes a test suite to verify the correctness of the algorithm implementation:

```bash
python -m unittest test_algorithm.py
```

### Test Cases

-Test with XOR dataset for classification correctness.
-Test edge cases with empty inputs.
-Test parameter validation for learning rate and epochs

## Live Demo

A live demo of this application is available at: [Insert Streamlit Cloud URL here]

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

-Limited to small datasets due to visualization complexity.
-Only supports binary classification.
-No support for advanced optimizers or deep networks.

### Planned Improvements

-Support for multi-class classification.
-Add more activation functions.
-Enhance UI for better interactivity.
